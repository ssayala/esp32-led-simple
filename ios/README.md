# LED Ticker iOS App

SwiftUI + CoreBluetooth app that mirrors `tools/led.py` — configure the
ESP32 LED Ticker over BLE from your iPhone or iPad.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15 or newer
- iOS 16+ device (the iOS simulator has no Bluetooth radio)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen): `brew install xcodegen`

## Build

```bash
cd ios
xcodegen generate
open LEDTicker.xcodeproj
```

Then in Xcode:

1. Select the **LEDTicker** scheme.
2. Pick your physical iPhone/iPad as the run destination.
3. Build & run (⌘R). iOS will prompt for Bluetooth permission on first
   launch.

## Signing

The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` and the pbxproj is
gitignored, so **do not edit signing in Xcode's Signing & Capabilities
pane** — UI edits get wiped the next time `xcodegen generate` runs.

Signing is driven by two xcconfig files in this directory:

| File                    | Checked in? | Purpose                                    |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Signing.xcconfig`      | Yes         | Safe defaults (style, identity). No team.  |
| `Signing.local.xcconfig`| **No**      | Your personal `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` override. |

Simulator builds work out of the box with no local override.

For **device builds**, create `ios/Signing.local.xcconfig` with a single
line:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOURTEAMID
```

You can find your Team ID at
<https://developer.apple.com/account> → Membership. Then run
`xcodegen generate` and build to your device as usual. The `.local`
file is gitignored so your team ID never lands in the public repo.

## Run tests

```bash
cd ios
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild test \
    -project LEDTicker.xcodeproj \
    -scheme LEDTicker \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

The test target only exercises `Payloads.swift` (pure formatting logic).
`BLEManager` needs a real device and is not unit-tested.

## Layout

```

├── LEDTicker/
│   ├── LEDTickerApp.swift The @main entry point
│   ├── BLEManager.swift   CoreBluetooth wrapper: scan, connect, queued writes
│   ├── Payloads.swift     Pure payload formatters (mirrors tools/led.py)

## Design notes

- **Four-tab layout**: Device (connection, WiFi, API key, reset),
  Stocks (tickers + show-on-display), Weather (locations + show-on-display),
  Messages (scrolling text + show-on-display).
- **Last-known values** are persisted to `UserDefaults` so the UI has
  something to show before a connection is established. On connect the
  app reads current config from the device and overwrites those fields,
  so the UI matches real device state. The WiFi password is never
  exposed over BLE and stays blank until the user retypes it.
- **Writes and reads are both queued**: every operation uses
  `.withResponse` / `readValue(for:)` and the next is only issued after
  the corresponding delegate fires. This matters because the firmware
  has a 10 s cooldown on ticker/reload/reset writes.
- **Auto-reconnect**: on first successful connect the peripheral UUID is
  saved to `UserDefaults`. Subsequent launches call
  `retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:)` to reconnect without scanning.
- **No WiFi auto-fill**: iOS does not expose the phone's SSID or
  password to apps without the Access WiFi Information entitlement
  (paid developer account + extra permissions), and never the password.
  The user must type both in.

## Protocol reference

See `../README.md` and `../CLAUDE.md` for the authoritative description
of the BLE service and its characteristics. Payload formats:

| Char      | UUID suffix | Payload                                       |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| tickers   | `...A8`     | `AAPL,MSFT,...` (comma-separated)             |
| mode      | `...A9`     | `stocks`, `messages`, or `weather`            |
| messages  | `...AA`     | `m1\|m2\|...` (≤ 511 bytes)                   |
| command   | `...AB`     | `reload` or `reset`                           |
| wifi      | `...AC`     | `SSID\|password` (split on first `\|`)        |
| apikey    | `...AD`     | plain string                                  |
| locations | `...AE`     | `ZIP\|City, State\|...` (≤ 5 entries, 204 B)  |
